#Wrting Short Essays from Foreign Songs

I'll paint a scene from this song:

It's during a sunset, the sky glows a red-purple tinge and there's a young woman walking alongside the train tracks in the outskirts of busy Tokyo.  It is about 40 minutes away from the busiest intersection of Shibuya. She holds a transparent umbrella--not to avoid the sun but because she senses, from the quick humid wind on the back of her head, that rain is coming.

As she walks along the tracks, a distance train starts closing in.  The sound grew louder in an ascending tone like the air vibrations out a hollow cone.  As the train passes her by, she flashes back to memories of herself walking home alone, along the tracks, after school. She sighs, not knowing what emotion it was. 

The residual wind moves her dress gracefully and her hair danced and tangled in the wind.  The clouds start turning slight grey and shade the sun rays.  

Soon little drops of rain start pouring down. "Tip tap tip tap", it wets the face of the earth. "Tip tap tip tap", as she slowly traces her steps back home.
